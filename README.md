# Base images

This repository contains recipies (Containerfiles/Dockerfiles) for building base images for use in SPK.

The container images are currently built using `podman` on internal GitHub Runners.

## ⚙️ Containerfile customisation

The `Containerfiles` take advantage of the `ARG` instruction to allow for customisation of the build process.
Inspect each `Containerfile` for the available arguments.

## 🪨 Rocky Linux 8 and 9

Based on the latest `rockylinux` images.
Primarily used as base images for other images.
We set the timezone to Europe/Oslo and install internal SPK root CA certificates,
as well as adding, but not enabling, internal Yum repositories.

Available versions:

* `8`
* `8-minimal`
* `9`
* `9-minimal`

### Yum repositories

As default, only standard external yum repositories are enabled, no internal SPK repos.
That means you can use it on cloud runners.

If you need to install SPK-RPMs, you need to build on our internal runners,
enable the SPK repos, and disable the mirrorlist in the standard repos.
The repo config can be done by running the script `yum-switch-to-internal-repos.sh`
in your build file, as root, before `dnf install`.
